✨ Alongside my technical skills, I bring strong problem-solving, adaptability, and critical thinking that help me thrive in dynamic environments. With excellent knowledge of UI/UX design principles, I’m passionate about creating interfaces that are not only functional but also meaningful and engaging.

🏸 Outside of academics, I enjoy playing badminton and learning from diverse experiences that enrich my perspective.
